This is a full Spring security based project to understand how the JWT process flow works
The Database used over here is jwt_security
Application.yml is used over here for making the connection with teh Database
User class is made to make the Dtabase Table with the name _user and this is achieved by using different tags
Now with respect to the security the most important one we need to add is the userDetail class
